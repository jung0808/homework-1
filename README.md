**I edited my HTML and CSS page**

I edited HTML file to have a better semantic strucutre. 

Also in CSS file, I combined elements, class, and ID's so that there are no redundancy and made sure that selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic strucutre. Furthermore, I also made comments on each CSS line to show what I combined and edited. 

Application is deployed on my github.
